# Data_Cleaning
Repository used as portfolio for data cleaning skills and improvements.

I got this dataset from Tableau Public's library.
It's a big dataset containing information about the top 5.000 USA companies in 2014.
I used SQLite for all the data cleaning queries.

**Why clean it?**

It wasn't a very messy dataset, but it contained some irrelevant and repetitive columns.
It also had a long and overly complicated name, which I shortened for practicality.
